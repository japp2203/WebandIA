    Minot Daily News: 1915 Headline Font
    ---------------------------------


    This font is based on the newspaper headline style used on the front page of the Minot Daily News in 1915.

    It is a narrow, sans serif, block-style font, similar in some regards to the Athletic Sans font found in the America Online libraries.

    This type style comes from an era when newspaper headlines were tall and squeezed together to allow as much information as possible.

    It is most effective above 36 points.

    It is an all cap font, with basic punctuation.

    It was developed using Fontographer software.
